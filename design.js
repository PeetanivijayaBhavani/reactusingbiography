   Super humans. We read about them, watch them and admire them in the virtual world , but I live with a superhuman.
   She is my mother.I am Vijaya Bhavani, a 20-year-old student.My mother, Mrs Peetani Savithri, is my role model. 
   She inspires and motivates me to grow without any barriers. It seems to me that this woman looks at life as a
   challenge and wholeheartedly intends to seize the day every day.  
   My mother looked after me and supported me in every part of my life. Right from childhood she has been with me 
   like my shadow. It had been riddled with hurdles and difficulties, but she has managed to cross them all to because
   of the amazing and independent person she is.
   A mother is the truest friend we have, when trials heavy and sudden fall upon us; when adversity takes the place of 
   prosperity; when friends desert us; when trouble thickens around us, still will she cling to us, and endeavor by her 
   kind precepts and counsels to dissipate the clouds of darkness, and cause peace to return to our hearts.
